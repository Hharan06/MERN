# MERN Authentication Project

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that implements user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). It allows users to log in and interact with a simple interface. This README provides information about the project setup, usage, and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- Git (optional, for version control)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Initialize a new Node.js project:

   ```
   npm init -y
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install express mongoose jsonwebtoken bcryptjs dotenv cors cookie-parser cloudinary
   ```

4. Install nodemon for development:

   ```
   npm install nodemon
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Create a new Vite project with React:

   ```
   npm create vite@latest . --template react
   ```

3. Install any additional dependencies required for the frontend:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Scripts

In the backend `package.json`, include the following:

```json
{
  "main": "backend/server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon backend/server.js",
    "start": "node backend/server.js"
  },
  "type": "module"
}
```

### Usage

To run the backend server, navigate to the backend folder and use the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

To run the frontend development server, navigate to the frontend folder and use:

```
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

To deploy your application, you can use platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or Render. Make sure to set the appropriate environment variables in your hosting provider's settings.

1. **Backend**: You may need to configure your server to listen to the correct port and allow cross-origin requests from your frontend.
2. **Frontend**: Deploy your frontend to Vercel or Netlify, linking it to your GitHub repository for automatic deployments on push.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
